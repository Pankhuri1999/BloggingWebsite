<button class="accordion"><b><h3><font color="#A93226">Our Growth Story</font></b></h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
ONGC was set up under the visionary leadership of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru. Pandit Nehru reposed faith in Shri Keshav Dev Malviya who laid the foundation of ONGC in the form of Oil and Gas division, under Geological Survey of India, in 1955. A few months later, it was converted into an Oil and Natural Gas Directorate. The Directorate was converted into Commission and christened Oil & Natural Gas Commission on 14th August 1956.

"Not only had India..set up her own machinery for oil exploration and exploitation... an efficient oil commission had been built where a large number of bright young men and women had been trained and they were doing good work" said Pandit JawaharLal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister to Lord Mountbatten, on ONGC in 1959.

In 1994, Oil and Natural Gas Commission was converted in to a Corporation, and in 1997 it was recognized as one of the Navratnas by the Government of India. Subsequently, it has been conferred with Maharatna status in the year 2010.

In its 60 years of illustrious journey, ONGC has crossed many a milestone to realize the energy aspirations of India. The journey of ONGC, over these years, has been a tale of conviction, courage and commitment. ONGCs’ superlative efforts have resulted in converting earlier frontier areas into new hydrocarbon provinces. From a modest beginning, ONGC has grown to be one of the largest E&P companies in the world in terms of reserves and production.

</p></div>

<button class="accordion"><b><h3><font color="#A93226">Core Business Expertise</font></b></h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) is a global energy holding company, engaged in the oil exploration, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas. Its segments include Exploration & Production (E&P), and Refining.

ONGC's on-going upstream exploratory efforts are an important segment of its core E&P Business in India with the responsibility of finding and accreting oil and gas reserves. It has three facets of hydrocarbon exploration activities viz. Deep Water, Shallow Water, and Onshore exploration activities.

Seismic Data Acquisition Processing & Interpretation (API)
Seismic data is collected through special wing called “Geophysical services” in form of 2D/3D surveys done by ONGC’s own survey party/vessels/equipment (in-house) as well as through contractual hiring by survey contracts. The same process is applicable for bore-hole seismic/wire-line logging through a separate arm called “Logging services”.

oil exploration in india

Geophysical Services carry out 2D, 3D, and VSP seismic survey operations in on-land and marine through its departmental field parties/ contractual crews. The operation, maintenance, and processing of data acquired are to a large extent done regionally, e.g. Vadodara region caters to entire West India land Geophysical operations, Dehradun region caters to North and Central India, Jorhat to North East, Mumbai to entire marine requirements, etc. The equipment support to field operations is provided by the Regional electronic laboratories (RELs). The seismic data acquired is processed at Regional computer centers (RCCs) including GEOPIC. Presently, the marine 2D, 3D and VSP data acquisition operations are carried out through outsourcing. All the field crews, RCCs and RELs are accredited with ISO certification.

The Geophysical Services, to keep pace with the latest developments in Geosciences and exploration, routinely replaces and upgrades its equipment, lab equipment and computers and its peripherals. Recently, it has acquired 3 new VSP data acquisition systems and 10 Field Processing Units (FPUs). Advanced imaging software modules like Earth Study ES-360 and add-on modules namely MPFI (5D interpolation) and GSMP (De Multiple) of OMEGA software have been procured for SPIC, Mumbai.

Logging is known to be the “Eye” of E&P Industry enabling the geo-scientists to visualize the formation and reservoir characteristics. Logging services are responsible for the good logging field operations involving a number of techniques for measurement of petrophysical parameters of geological formations penetrated by the drill bit. Data is collected and processed in the form of logs (Petrophysical parameters vs. depth).The data is then interpreted to obtain the parameters for hydrocarbon potential, flow characteristics etc. of the well.

The entire Logging database is captured on the EPINET platform which is accessible across the organization for timely and effective decision making. A dedicated R&D institute for Logging services ‘’Centre for Excellence in Well Logging” (CEWELL) is operational at Vadodara which is catering to field specific formation evaluation and Reservoir Characterization problems of assets and basins. Very few companies in the world are equipped with in-house logging capabilities. Today the Logging Services of ONGC is the biggest national endeavor of its kind with strong Operations, Repair Maintenance, Data Interpretation and R&D capabilities.

Presently, 28 Departmental Logging Units (24 in Onshore locations and 4 units in Mumbai Offshore) and 65 Contractual units have been deployed.

ONGC is in the process of replacement of 23 state-of-art logging units with tools, 19 for onshore locations and 4 units for western offshore. Two new Departmental Logging Bases will be coming up at Agartala and Bokaro with 2 units each. With this replacement, the entire logging fleet would consist of latest equipment which would improve technical capabilities and operational efficiency.

Recently, several initiatives for sprucing up the safety environment in Logging operations have been taken which include installation of speed governors and GPS for the motion tracking of Logging Units. Initiative for CCTV coverage of Logging operational area during logging for better surveillance and operational safety has been ensured at all locations.

Non- Seismic Data Acquisition Processing & Interpretation (API)
ONGC initiated efforts for better subsurface imaging in logistically difficult areas of North-East and has acquired about 5574 Km2 of Airborne Gravity Gradiometry (AGG) survey data in Cachar (Pre-NELP Block, AA-ONJ/2) and NELP block, AA-ONN-2001/2 in Mizoram and South East Geleki in North Assam Shelf. This data will help to unlock new hydrocarbon reserves which would augment its reserves base and increase in production.</p>

<button class="accordion"><b><h3><font color="#A93226">E&P Technology</font></b></h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>
E&P company in India

ONGC is one of the largest E&P Company in India with in-house service capabilities in all the activity areas of exploration and production of oil & gas and related oil-field services. The state-of-the-art technologies inducted and absorbed over the years such as depth domain processing, stratigraphic inversion, advanced volume based interpretation tools, stochastic lithofacies modeling using neural network, spectral decomposition, geo-statistical modeling, etc.

“Dedicated to excellence by leveraging competitive advantages in R&D and technology with involved people” – Mission of ONGC

Committee of ONGC Institutes
As India’s premier Maharatna, ONGC has pioneered in research and technology development in the country, setting up twelve world-class Institutes under the aegis of ‘Committee of ONGC Institutes’ or ‘COIN’. These twelve institutes have become the backbone of India’s hydrocarbon industry and support the entire spectrum of Oil and Gas production, which begins at the well bore and culminates at the consumer point.

EPINET
ONGC has set benchmarks for industry to follow. ONGC has setup EPINET, through which a live E&P information network and a virtual database has been developed for Basin & Petroleum System Modeling of various basins. Through SCADA all production and drilling executives at different levels utilize and reap benefits of online SCADA data for enhanced operational efficiency and productivity.

3-D virtual reality centers
ONGC has set up four 3-D virtual reality centers known as 'Third Eye' for real time dissemination and information of onshore and offshore applications. These centers are used for exploration and production activities including real-time surveillance of producing oil and gas fields thus helping ONGC network all its centers together by parallel computing technologies for all the major projects.

SAP implementation started by ONGC’s management
Thinking ahead of times, in 2002, ONGC’s management started the SAP implementation, which turned out to be the largest India has ever seen. ONGC is now moving towards a paperless office through adoption of latest pioneering technologies.

ONGC embarked upon realignment of its multi-faceted business activities through the powerful medium of Information Technology. The IT mission was realigned ‘To develop an integrated, flexible and standardized Information Technology architecture to position ONGC towards fundamental competitive advantage’. The existing standalone applications (UFSO – for Financial Management, SHRAMIK for Human Resource Management, IMMS for Material Management etc) and other legacy information systems were brought together under a common ERP platform. Thus, Project ICE, Information Consolidation for Efficiency was born, out of the strategic vision of the ONGC’s board, particularly that of Mr. Subir Raha, the then C&MD with the motto of “One Organisation, One Data and One Information”.

Project ICE
ONGC has also implemented an enterprise-wide ERP implementation by the name of Project ICE. It comprised of 23 SAP modules in more than 500 physical locations across the length and breadth of the country, starting from mobile Survey units at Jwalamukhi of Himachal Pradesh to Deep Sea vessels at Bay of Bengal, from Production installations at far flung areas of Assam to Drilling rigs in the desert of Rajasthan.

Over the years, ONGC has developed a formidable capability in ultra-deepwater drilling. Since 2004, ONGC has drilled over 100 deepwater wells. A large number of these wells are in daunting water depths beyond 5000 feet in environmentally and logistically difficult areas of Indian East Coast and West Coast, ranging from Gujarat offshore to Mahanadi offshore including 6 wells in Andaman offshore. Out of these, around 25 wells have been drilled in water depths of 5000 feet to 7500 feet and 16 wells in water depths of 7500 feet to 10000 feet. The current world record well # 1-D-1, which is under drilling, is the 3rd well in beyond 10000 feet water depth.ONGC has achieved this commendable feat due to a sustained effort over the years to keep pace with latest technology in hydrocarbon exploration and it is one of the few companies in the world to have drilled a large number of ultra-deepwater wells in diverse and challenging areas.

Having gone through the tough grind in deepwater operations during last fifteen years, ONGC is today fully geared up to stand up to any challenge in ultra-deepwater drilling operations in pursuit of energy security for the nation.

Collaboration with Indian Institutes of Technology
In early 2015, ONGC signed a Memorandum of Collaboration (MoC) with seven IITs for developing indigenous technologies to enhance exploration and production of hydrocarbons and alternate energy sources. Under the MoC, ONGC's R&D Institutes and the IITs shall jointly undertake advanced research and development projects for the exploration and production (E&P) sector of the country in general and oilfield specific activities of ONGC in particular.</p>
